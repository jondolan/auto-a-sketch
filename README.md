# Auto-A-Sketch

Introduction
The Auto-A-Sketch is a raspberry pi and arduino based project. The system draws JPEG images on an Etch-A-Sketch. The pi generates motor instructions, and the arduino operates as a position motor controller. A simulator also shows the image on a monitor as the image is drawn on the Etch-A-Sketch.
